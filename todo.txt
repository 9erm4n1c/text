redo indentation

get a c++ lint/format rule setup

"r"

"P" for "dd"

write tests for command.cpp

refactor command.cpp

write tests for cursor.cpp

refactor cursor.cpp

write tests for window.cpp

refactor window.cpp

move tests into a tests folder in project root

prevent quit when changes

when line wrapping, if there isn't a new line to wrap to, it gets stuck

it doesn't handle broken ":" commands like ":asdf"

"dd" keeps the cursor in the same spot

pressing <enter> in insert mode at the end of the buffer breaks whereas "o" in normal mode doesn't

mouse scrolling doesn't work

if command_mode errors, I can't immediately go back into command mode to retype the command

undo

camelCase -> snake_case (maybe use a java script)

When the line is so long that it linewraps, the inserts after it are broken (because the ncurses line increments while the logical line doesn't )
