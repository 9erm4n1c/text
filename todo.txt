DONE 2022-03-09: after ":" cmd, buffer needs to go back to correct location

encapsulate commands and the gui interface they use in a class 
"f"

write tests for command.cpp

refactor command.cpp

write tests for cursor.cpp

refactor cursor.cpp

write tests for window.cpp

refactor window.cpp

move tests into a tests folder in project root

prevent quit when changes

when line wrapping, if there isn't a new line to wrap to, it gets stuck

it doesn't handle broken ":" commands like ":asdf"

"dd" keeps the cursor in the same spot

pressing <enter> in insert mode at the end of the buffer breaks whereas "o" in normal mode doesn't

mouse scrolling doesn't work

undo

camelCase -> snake_case (maybe use a java script)

When the line is so long that it linewraps, the inserts after it are broken (because the ncurses line increments while the logical line doesn't )
